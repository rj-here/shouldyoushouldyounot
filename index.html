    <h1>Should You or Should You Not?</h1>
    <h2>
        This project has some inspiration from the concept of utiltarianism, something I've learned in the introduction to ethics (PHIL 2070), and to applied ethics (PHIL 2075) courses at York University. 
        The textbooks used are Everyday Ethics, by Brian Huss & Applied Ethics: An Impartial Introudction by Elizabeth Jackson, Tyron Goldschmidt, Dustin Crummett, and Rebecca Chan.</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome! This is going to be a helper, looking to assist you (not do it for you) in making that decision that you are unable to make. It relates back to utiltarianism, as it evaluates the good or bad in a numbered scale, with a value given to each point by you, the user, hence the correlation.
